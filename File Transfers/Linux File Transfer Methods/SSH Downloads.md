SSH (or Secure Shell) is a protocol that allows secure access to remote computers. SSH implementation comes with an `SCP` utility for remote file transfer that, by default, uses the SSH protocol.

`SCP` (secure copy) is a command-line utility that allows you to copy files and directories between two hosts securely. We can copy our files from local to remote servers and from remote servers to our local machine.

`SCP` is very similar to `copy` or `cp`, but instead of providing a local path, we need to specify a username, the remote IP address or DNS name, and the user's credentials.

Before we begin downloading files from our target Linux machine to our Pwnbox, let's set up an SSH server in our Pwnbox.

#### Enabling the SSH Server

```shell-session
pepedavidphone@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl enable ssh

Synchronizing state of ssh.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable ssh
Use of uninitialized value $service in hash element at /usr/sbin/update-rc.d line 26, <DATA> line 45
...SNIP...
```

#### Starting the SSH Server

```shell-session
pepedavidphone@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl start ssh
```

#### Checking for SSH Listening Port

```shell-session
pepedavidphone@htb[/htb]$ netstat -lnpt

(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      - 
```

Now we can begin transferring files. We need to specify the IP address of our Pwnbox and the username and password.

#### Linux - Downloading Files Using SCP

```shell-session
pepedavidphone@htb[/htb]$ scp plaintext@192.168.49.128:/root/myroot.txt . 
```

**Note:** You can create a temporary user account for file transfers and avoid using your primary credentials or keys on a remote computer.
